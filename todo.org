* DONE When key is held down, make it repeat
What I have tried so far is not working ( it has to do with state between keyboard checks)
* DONE Change the font
* DONE Show cursor
* DONE Write more than just letters
* DONE Put cursor in multi-lines
* TODO make structs and functions
* TODO Improve alg for repeating key
* TODO write in the middle of line
Will need to do some mem.copy stuff etc, look a tsoding ded code for insperation
* TODO Line wrapping
* TODO make hierarchical headers
* TODO toggle todo/done on headers
* TODO save state to file
