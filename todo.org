* DONE When key is held down, make it repeat
What I have tried so far is not working ( it has to do with state between keyboard checks)
* DONE Change the font
* DONE Show cursor
* TODO Write more than just letters
* TODO Put cursor in multi-lines
* TODO Line wrapping
* TODO make structs and functions
* TODO make hierarchical headers
* TODO toggle todo/done on headers
* TODO save state to file
